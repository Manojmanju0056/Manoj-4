## CoffeeToken

# Introduction

Welcome to the CoffeeToken smart contract, a decentralized system for tokenized coffee transactions built on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract allows coffee enthusiasts to engage in various actions, including minting, burning, redeeming, and transferring CoffeeTokens.

# Features

## Minting Tokens

Owners can mint new CoffeeTokens using the `mintingTokens` function, providing the ability to generate additional tokens.

## Burning Tokens

Users can destroy their CoffeeTokens securely through the `BurningTokens` function, ensuring controlled token destruction.

## Redeeming Coffee

Users can exchange CoffeeTokens for cups of coffee by specifying the coffee type and the desired number of cups in the `redeemingCoffee` function.

## Transferring Tokens

Seamlessly transfer CoffeeTokens between addresses using the `transferingTokens` function, facilitating easy sharing and management.

## Checking Balances and Total Supply

Use the `getBalance` function to check the CoffeeToken balance of a specific account and `getTotalSupply` to retrieve the total supply of CoffeeTokens in circulation.

## Coffee Rate Inquiry

Query the rates associated with different coffee types using the `getRateForCoffee` function before redeeming tokens, ensuring transparency in the redemption process.

# Getting Started
